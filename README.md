 # Social Network API
 <br>
 MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.This project builds an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. The project uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
